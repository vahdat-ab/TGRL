# TGRL
This project defines a textual modeling language for Goal-Oriented Requirement Language (GRL). It has been developing in Xtext and the editor can be installed as a plugin on Eclipse IDE. In order to get benefits of the language's editor, the extension of files must be '*.xgrl'. There is also a convertor which allows having visula representtaion of textual model in jUCMNav. 

In order to install these two Eclipse plugins, please just copy four ".jar" files inside the plugin folder into the pluging folder of your Eclipse.

The plugins need two package including Xtext and Acceleo so as to be able to run properly.
