# TGRL

This project defines a *textual* modeling language for *Goal-Oriented Requirement Language (GRL)*. It has been developing in *Xtext* and the editor can be installed as a plugin on *Eclipse* IDE. In order to get benefits of the language's editor, the extension of files must be '\**.xgrl*'. There is also a convertor which allows having visual representaion of textual models in [jUCMNav](http://jucmnav.softwareengineering.ca/ucm/bin/view/ProjetSEG/WebHome). 

In order to install these two *Eclipse* plugins, please just copy four ".jar" files inside the plugin folder into the pluging folder of your *Eclipse*.

The plugins need two packages including *Xtext* and *Acceleo* so as to be able to run properly.

Xtext:  https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/   
Acceleo: https://www.eclipse.org/acceleo/

You can watch the full tutorial [here](https://youtu.be/VSAMiAW1Rks) regarding how to install *TGRL* and required plugins, create a simple textual model, and generate *jUCMNav* graphical model.
